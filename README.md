Hello! My name is Beck and I am a recent graduate from the Univeristy of Pittsburgh with a bachelor's degree in Psychology.
I have a passion for user experiience design and cognitive psychology research, and I hope to persue a graduate-level education in Human Computer Interaction. This profile serves as a portfolio of my work in psychology, research, coding, and other work.
